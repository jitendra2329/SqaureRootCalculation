Assignment 

####
In a list of numbers return the square root of all the numbers.

Sample Input: List(4, 16, 25, 36), 
Sample Output List(2, 4, 5, 6)

=> I have used map for iterating over elements of list and then sqrt method for getting the square root of the numbers in list.

=> It is not possible to get square root of negative numbes, in this case, the method will throw an Exception(handled in the test class)
